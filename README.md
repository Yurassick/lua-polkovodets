Currently the team is russian-speaking, except the main developer. The community forum can be found 
here https://vk.com/club101507354 (russian-speaking). 

If you are not russian-speaking, but would like to join development (code, graphics, concepts), please, contact me via github. 

The project is on early stage, so, no translation efforts are required now.
